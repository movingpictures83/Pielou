# Language: R
# Input: TXT
# Output: CSV
# Tested with: PluMA 1.1, R 4.0.0

PluMA plugin that computes Pielou evenness (Pielou, 1966) for a sample set.

The following are specified in the input TXT file, as tab-delimited keyword-value pairs.

otufile: OTU abundances (CSV)
mapping: Mapping table (CSV)
tree: Phylogenetic tree (CSV)

Metrics are then generated in the output CSV file, with rows corresponding to samples and columns to metrics.

Format of the otufile CSV:
- Rows are OTUs, columns are samples
- Entry (i,j) is the abundance of OTU in sample j.  Can be absolute or relative.

Format of the mapping CSV:
- Rows are samples, columns are metadata
- One single header row, i.e: sample,subject,visit

Format of the tree CSV;
- Rows are OTUs, columns are classifications
- One single header row, i.e. OTU,Kingdom,Phylum,Class,Order,Family,Genus,Species
